abstract = {Competence-based education requires changing teacher roles probably affecting teacher–student interactions and student motivation. This study examines how students (N = 1469) from competence-based and less-competence-based vocational schools perceive their teachers' interpersonal behaviour and its relation with their motivation. Results showed comparable teacher profiles in CBE and less-CBE schools, with an unexpected difference at the dimension level. Perceived teacher interpersonal behaviour moderated connections between CBE and student motivation, with greater impact in less-CBE than in CBE learning environments. Required changes in teacher roles are not yet perceived, hampering the expectations of increased motivation in competence-based education.}

abstract = {In this paper, the authors show that augmented reality technology has a positive impact on the motivation of middle-school students. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) (Keller, 2010) based on the ARCS motivation model (Keller, 1987a) was used to gather information; it considers four motivational factors: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Motivational factors of attention and satisfaction in an augmented-reality-based learning environment were better rated than those obtained in a slides-based learning environment. When the impact of the augmented reality system was analyzed in isolation, the attention and confidence factors were the best rated. The usability study showed that although this technology is not mature enough to be used massively in education, enthusiasm of middle-school students diminished most of the barriers found.}
